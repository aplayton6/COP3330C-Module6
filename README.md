This program serves two purposes: the first part returns the index in an array where a particular element
is located, and the second part runs a custom method to determine which of two objects contains
a larger integer.

The user will not supply any inputs except for those that are already input in the program.
The outputs will be the locations in each of the different arrays for which the search method finds
the desired element, as well as the object that contains the higher integer.
